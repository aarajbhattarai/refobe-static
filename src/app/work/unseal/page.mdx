## Overview

The prosthetic arm, leveraging brain signals (EEG), represents a significant advancement in assistive technology. By interpreting neural commands from the user's brain, the prosthetic arm can execute complex movements with remarkable precision and fluidity. This innovative approach enables individuals with limb loss or impairment to regain a level of dexterity and control previously unattainable with traditional prosthetics. Through the integration of neural interface technology, the prosthetic arm facilitates intuitive and natural movement, empowering users to perform a wide range of tasks with confidence and efficiency. This underscores a paradigm shift in assistive technology, offering new possibilities for enhanced mobility and independence.
